*"Commander, heed my words! The tides of battle are ever-changing, and victory is never assured. In war, defeat does not mean destruction—it means opportunity."*  

When an army falls, what becomes of its soldiers? Do they simply vanish into the dust, forgotten and powerless? No! In this war-torn age, warriors do not fade away—they seek refuge, they pledge new oaths, they march under new banners!  

With the **Refugee’s Mod**, the fall of an ally is not a death knell—it is a rallying cry. When a player is struck down, their remaining soldiers do not stand idly by, awaiting slaughter. Instead, they **defect**—offering their swords, spears, and bows to their surviving allies. This is more than a mere mechanic; it is a **shift in power**. It is the difference between a fragile alliance and an **unbreakable brotherhood of arms**.  

**Imagine the battlefield…**  
Your enemy, arrogant and foolish, marches their hero into battle without caution. You seize the opportunity, striking them down and erasing their presence from the war. But instead of watching their empire crumble into nothingness, their soldiers rally under a new banner—one of your foes now reinforced by the very warriors you thought defeated.  

The war is no longer just about conquest—it is about **strategy, loyalty, and the power of true alliances**. Every choice matters. **Will you allow your enemies to bolster each other, or will you ensure no warrior is left to fight against you?**  

The fate of the battlefield is no longer determined by sheer force alone. It is determined by those who understand that **even in defeat, there is strength**.  

Now tell me, Commander—who stands with you? And who will you let rise against you?
